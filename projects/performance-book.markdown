This book on writing fast Haskell code, including a detailed treatment of profilers and other measurement tools as well as optimization techniques that enable action based on profiles, was contributed to the HF by [IOG](https://iohk.io/), who continue to sponsor its writing. In addition to a describing tools and techniques, the book also provides case studies, showing how to dramatically improve the performance of real Haskell programs.
