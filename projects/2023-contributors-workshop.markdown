In order to make it easier for new contributors to get involved with GHC, the Haskell Foundation worked with OST Eastern Switerland University of Applied Sciences and the GHC developers to organize a three-day hands-on introduction, which was attended by 43 in-person participants, nine speakers from the GHC project, and six additional volunteers from the HF, OST, and the GHC project. This hybrid-online event was recorded, and the videos are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQpeDZt0_xQfTQPvjsT1ub-qVPXJ6fVy0), where they can be a continuing resource for new GHC developers and intermediate Haskellers who want to learn more about how GHC compiles their code.
