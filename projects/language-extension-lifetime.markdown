Haskell language extensions are the mechanism by which language research and innovation are made optional. However, it is not always easy to see which extensions are expected to change and develop, and which are finished. The Haskell Foundation's [Stability Working Group](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/stability) is working on a simple, understandable classification that allows teams to make informed decisions about the tradeoffs between stability and innovation and to have their stability policy reflected in compiler warnings.
