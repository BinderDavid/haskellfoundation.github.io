The Haskell Foundation assisted the GHC developers with getting feedback about short- to medium-term development priorities through a deliberative process, resulting in a list of priorities. The Haskell Foundation took care of contacting the users, clarifying their answers, sorting them by topic, and summarizing and analyzing the results. The HF then worked closely with the leadership of the GHC project to produce a report detailing their plans.
