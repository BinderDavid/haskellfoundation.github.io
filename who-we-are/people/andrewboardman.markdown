Andrew Boardman brings a varied background as a serial entrepreneur, manager, teacher, consultant, and financial professional. He started professional programming in high school, writing text editor software for electronic bulletin board systems. Since then he has been the tech lead for the Windows build lab, lead developer for Windows Live Messenger, worked on desktop publishing software at Quark, and co-founded five startups, and much more.

Andrew was drawn to Haskell in 2015 as the best solution to solve the truly difficult problems in computer science. Most recently he was a Haskell developer and engineering manager at SimSpace Corp., working on software for cybersecurity readiness training and testing. He is extremely excited about serving the community, and looks forward to working with everyone to address pain points and build on the languageâ€™s strengths.
