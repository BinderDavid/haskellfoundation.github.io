Emily Pillmore got her start on Wall St. as a consultant and financial professional, reverse engineering statistical models and providing technical audit. She started her programming career as a late bloomer at the University of Utah, learning Java and Perl. Ultimately deciding to pursue mathematics (Topology and Geometry), she found a way to combine these two loves via functional programming, and quickly changed careers to focus on Scala and Haskell in 2016. Since then, she has served as a senior engineer for Disney Streaming (working on Disney+), and as a core team member of [Kadena](https://kadena.io).

Emily has since developed a proclivity for OSS and community contributions, authoring or maintaining many well-known Haskell packages, contributing to Core Libraries and Haskell.org as a board member, and serving the Haskell Foundation as its first Working Group Chair. She looks forward to seeing Haskell flourish, and building some great tech that will make everyoneâ€™s Haskell experience that much better.
