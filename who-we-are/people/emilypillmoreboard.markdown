Emily is an advisor and engineer focused on language and systems development at Kadena. She helped found the Haskell Foundation as the first chair of its working group, and on its executive team as CTO. Before Haskell, she worked in finance on statistical models and technical audit on Wall St., and moonlighting as a mathematician. At some point, she decided Category Theory was a good idea to marry with programming, and found the Haskell community was already on it, opting to get her hands dirty on the Haskell.org committee, the Core Libraries Committee, and maintaining/authoring too many packages. She has since published a paper on the mathematics of optics, and, as a coping mechanism, is now working on applied subjects to regain her ability to interact with humans.
