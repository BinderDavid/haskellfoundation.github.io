More often known as Bodigrim, Andrew is an extremely active Haskell community member, library author and maintainer, speaker and mentor. He has made strides towards cleaning out backlogs for bytestring, text, unix, random, and vector, which were previously stalled. Andrew holds a PhD degree for contributions to the theory of the Riemann zeta-function and develops a range of mathematical packages with a focus on performance.
