Gabriele is Professor of Software Technology in the Department of Information and Computing Sciences. Her research focuses on how programming languages can be used to improve the quality of software. Conventional software testing is very important, but can’t guarantee the absence of errors. She is addressing this problem in her research on developing and using programming languages that are based on mathematical theory, so we can prove that a program will work in all scenarios. Call it ‘correctness by construction’. The real world significance is obvious: it saves a lot of time and it eliminates errors, so which company wouldn’t want it?
