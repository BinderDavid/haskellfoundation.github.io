order: 3

The Haskell.org committee has voted to affiliate with the Haskell Foundation, however the haskell.org committee remains an independent 501-3 (c) nonprofit organization. The haskell.org committee will continue to operate the haskell.org website and provide resources for Haskell infrastructure such as Hackage and the haskell mailing lists. Several members of haskell.org have helped launch HF.
