title: What Is The Relationship Between HF And The Community, Industry, Etc.
order: 1

The goal of the Haskell Foundation is to facilitate a dialogue for improvement, and center the Haskell community and its industry in one place. Previously, there were many disparate groups consisting of volunteers and members of industry working together to improve the state of Haskell. However, some things in the ecosystem are complicated, and require organization and funding to move forward. The Haskell Foundation addresses that need, and provides a central locus and flag for these groups to rally around to coordinate work, funding, and direction.
