Graham Hutton is interviewed by Wouter Swierstra and Andres LÃ¶h. Graham is known for his work on Haskell both in research and teaching Haskell, and in particular his Haskell book. Graham will tell us a little bit about how his book came about and give us advice for how to write a book ourselves, but also look back on his experience using Haskell and teaching Haskell in the last thirty years, and tell us a little bit about how bad the compile times were for the very first versions of GHC.
