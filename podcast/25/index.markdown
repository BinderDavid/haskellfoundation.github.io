In this episode Joachim Breitner and Wouter Swierstra talk to Andrew Lelechenko, also known as Bodigrim. Bodigrim went from a being a mathematician to a failed PHP developer the chair of the Core Libraries Committee. In this episode, we discuss whether he prefers number theory or Haskell, whether he prefers working with compilers or PHP frameworks, and whether he prefers high salaries for Haskell developers or breaking changes to the `base` library.
