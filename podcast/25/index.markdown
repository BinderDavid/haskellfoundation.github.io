In this episode Joachim Breitner and Wouter Swierstra talk to Andrew Lelechenko also known as Bodigrim. Bodigrim went from a mathematician in theory to a failed PhD developer to the chair of core libraries committee. In this episode we discuss if he prefers number theory or Haskell, is he prefers working with compilers or PhD frameworks, and if he prefers high salaries for Haskell developers or breaking changes to the base library.
