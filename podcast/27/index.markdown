In this episode Christiaan Baaij is interviewed by Wouter Swierstra and Mattias Páll. Christiaan talks about his work on the Clash compiler, what it is like to found your own company, his desire for ergonomic dependent types, and the foundations to all his success, namely capitalising on luck.


*Errata:* Around the 21m19s mark Christiaan talks about “his“ contributions to GHC with regards to dynamic linking on OSX. Later he remembered that it was actually Moritz Angermann who [worked on the symbol limit restrictions](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/b592bd98ff25730bbe3c13d6f62a427df8c78e28). However, Christiaan did [some other work on OSX linking](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/f7be53ac9dac85b83e7fe5ecede01b98a572ba48) and some of the [RPATH handling](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2255/commits).
