episode: 3
description: |
  Gabriella Gonzalez is interviewed by Joachim Breitner and Alejandro Serrano,
  and we talk about Dhall, Nix, and Haskell, learn why Gabriella's packages are
  sometimes called after characters of computer games, and get to know her
  elevator pitch for educating Haskell

  The interviewee now goes by Gabriella as their preferred name, but at the
  time was still using Gabriel.
