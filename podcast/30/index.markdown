In this episode Niki Vazou and Mattias Pall chat with Richard Eisenberg. Richard is currently a language designer at Jane Street, he is the chair of the board at the Haskell Foundation and known for his work on the GHC compiler.  Today we talk about dependent types in Haskell, how to get involved with GHC and Haskell foundation and how Haskell and Ocaml are different, for example, functor means a totally different thing in the two languages.
