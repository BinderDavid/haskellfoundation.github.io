In this episode, Bartosz Milewski is interviewed by Wouter Swierstra and Andres LÃ¶h. Bartosz shares his thoughts on the "fringe topics" in programming, from C++ templates to category theory in Haskell. How he considers monads to be like fingers sticking out of the water. And he'll talk a little bit about his upcoming book and his thoughts on linear types.
