Facundo Dominguez is interviewed by Niki Vazou and Joachim Breitner. Facundo
Dominguez tells us the difference between STM and SMT. We also talk about
Liquid Haskell and its relation to dependent types and the `QualifiedDo`
extension -- which is one of the most highly discussed GHC proposals --, and
the general GHC proposals. And, finally, Facundo describes a technique to have Haskell peacefully
coexist with other languages thanks to his work in the build system Bazel.
