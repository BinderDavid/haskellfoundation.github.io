Oskar Wickström is interviewed by Alejandro and Joachim Breitner, he will tell
us a little bit about property based testing Haskell code but also applying
these ideas to the testing of complete systems. A little bit about interfacing
Haskell to other languages and even your web browser and what it's like to
learn Rust as a Haskell programmer.
