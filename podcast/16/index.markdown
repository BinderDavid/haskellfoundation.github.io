Oskar Wickström is interviewed by Wouter Swierstra and Alejandro Serrano, he
will tell us a little bit about property-based testing (PBT) Haskell code but
also applying these ideas to the testing of complete systems. He will say a
little bit about interfacing Haskell to other languages and even with your web
browser and what it's like to learn Rust as a Haskell programmer.
