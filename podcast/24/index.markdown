In this episode Andres LÃ¶h and Niki Vazou chat with Jeremy Gibbons. Jeremy Gibbons is professor at Oxford and talks about his journey from Orwell to Haskell, how to teach Haskell and specification languages to undergraduates as well as professional programmers, how programming languages should keep simple things simple, and how paper writing can or even should be like poetry.
