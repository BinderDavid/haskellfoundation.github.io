Ningning Xie is interviewed by Niki Vazou and Andres Loh. Ningning first contributed to GHC at her Google summer of code project with a very ambitious goal of implementing the whole dependent Haskell. Also later she fixed several ghc bugs and worked on Kokaâ€™s Algebraic effects. Her future hope and advice is to use programming language concepts on real-word problems.
