Arnaud Spiwack is interviewed by Matthías Páll Gissurarson and Joachim Breitner. We learn all about linear types in Haskell, how linear types go beyond Rust’s ownership system and why it’s not always best to type check everything in core. We conclude with a peek into the many activities of Arnaud’s employer, Tweag.
