Sebastian Graf is interviewed by Joachim Breitner and Alejandro Serrano.  Sebastian is one of the most active contributors to GHC, and tells of this experience, from his very first commit to GHC to his current work on the pattern coverage checker and demand analyzer. He also gives us hints on how to reason about the strictness of Haskell programs.
