In this episode Wouter Swierstra and Joachim Breitner chat with Ben Gamari. Ben is a consultant at Well-Typed known for his work at GHC. Ben tells us a little bit about his switch from Python to Haskell but not because he was missing the static typing, how programming his thermostat lead him to a career in the compiler development, and what it's like to be a GHC force multiplier.
