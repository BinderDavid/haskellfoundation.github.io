Niki Vazou and Andres Löh are joined by guest Théophile Choutri (they/them), who
also goes by Hécate. Théophile coordinates multiple projects and volunteer
groups within the Haskell Foundation, notably the Haskell School project
(intending to provide a free online open source library for teaching Haskell),
and works on improving GHC core documentation and developing an alternative to
Hackage. Together they discuss Théophile's introduction to Haskell and their
ongoing projects with the Foundation and the broader community, with a focus on
the challenges facing Haskell non-experts and how they hope to tackle them.
