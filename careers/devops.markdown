# Description

The [Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation) is [looking for a DevOps engineer](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/accepted/003-ghc-ops.md) to take the Haskell ecosystem to the next level of stability, reliability, and performance.

This is a central role in the Haskell ecosystem, the primary responsibility is maintaining and improving the [CI](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/tree/master/.gitlab) infrastructure for GHC ([Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc)). However, once that is in good shape, we anticipate offering support to other core open source Haskell projects, such as Cabal, Stack, GHCup, Haskell Language Server, and core libraries.

The successful candidate will have exceptional DevOps skills in the current technology stack:

* Most GHC services are hosted by a single machine running NixOS, including:
  * PostgreSQL
  * GitLab
  * Grafana
  * Docker registry
* GitLab Pipelines
* Docker
* Heterogenous CI runners, covering Linux (AArch64, x86-64), Windows (x86-64), and Darwin (AArch64).

Additionally, this position is responsible for maintaining operating system dependent packaging of GHC and related tools.

## Likely future responsibilities

* Work with the [Haskell Infrastructure Team](https://github.com/haskell-infra/haskell-admins/).
* Improvements and expansion of the GHC performance dashboard.

# Qualifications

* Demonstrated ability to manage and simplify complexity
* Collaborate with a variety of stakeholders
* Ability to choose between multiple, conflicting priorities
* Excellent English written communication skills

# Bonus Points

* Some famliarity with Haskell packaging.
* Familiarity with platform-dependent software packaging (e.g. notarisation and code signing on Darwin).
* Some systems programming experience.

# Miscellaneous

This is a 100% remote position, reporting to the Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation, but taking technical direction from the GHC team (primarily Ben Gamari). Primary interactions will include people in US and European time zones, but can include coordination with people across the world at times.

Haskell knowledge is not required.

The Haskell Foundation does not discriminate based on race, creed, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, and family/parental status.

We offer competitive compensation and benefits (dependent on experience, logistics required to compensate the candidate in their locale, and relevant labor laws).
