## About the Haskell Foundation

The Haskell Foundation (HF) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to broadening the adoption of Haskell, by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research. More information about HF can be found on the web at [haskell.foundation](https://haskell.foundation).

## The Role

The Haskell Foundation seeks a full-time Executive Director (ED) to lead, inspire, and develop the organization. The ED is responsible for furthering HF’s mission and vision and ensuring that resources are in place to accomplish its goals. The ED will seek out sponsorships, structure the organization, and recruit and channel the efforts of both volunteers and paid staff.

Working with HF's Board of Directors, the ED will articulate HF’s strategic priorities and direction. They will assess and evaluate strategies, hire teams, set budgets, forge alliances, and build partnerships to further the mission. 

The ED will play a crucial role in building the culture of HF around community service. HF will succeed if and only if it succeeds in unlocking the expertise and enthusiasm of volunteer members of the community. This will be a major goal for the ED, so that volunteers find HF to be a solid professional home with ample opportunities for recognition and professional growth. A successful ED will be adept at navigating among the community’s differing priorities and values.

Finally, the ED will actively promote HF to build its financial reserves and goodwill. They will secure, budget, and allocate resources appropriately and hold themselves accountable for the financial health of the organization.

There are many ways to be successful in this role, and many different kinds of people make sense. Very few people are good at every aspect already today, and part of the job of the ED is to compensate for any shortcomings by arranging support to round out the role. If you're unsure about whether your background has adequately prepared you, **please apply** - the board will work with you to find a way to make you successful.

## Reporting Relationships

The ED reports to the Board of Directors. All other members of staff and volunteers report directly or indirectly to the ED.

## Responsibilities

**Organization Mission and Strategy:** Works with the Board and staff to ensure that the mission is fulfilled. The ED will be responsible for:

 * Implementation of volunteer programs that carry out the organization’s mission.
 * Recruiting existing community projects to align with HF, and for assessing their ongoing adherence to HF standards.
 * Enhancing HF's image by being engaged with the community and by working closely with other professional and private organizations.
 * Acting as the public face of HF through public presentations at Haskell-related events. 
 * Cultivating excellent relationships with the community and operating HF’s social media presence.
 
**Organization Operations:** Oversees and implements appropriate resources to ensure the effectiveness of the organization. The ED will be responsible for:

 * Hiring and retention of competent, qualified staff and contractors as financial resources permit.
 * Effective administration of HF’s operations.
 * Signing all notes, agreements, and other instruments made and entered into and on behalf of the organization.
 * Fiscal management that generally anticipates operating within the approved budget, ensures maximum resource utilization, and maintenance of the organization in a positive financial position.
 
**Viability:** Develops financial resources sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the organization. The ED will be responsible for:

 * Fundraising and developing other revenues necessary to support HF’s mission.
 * Identifying and cultivating corporate, institutional and individual sponsors.
 
**Board Governance:** Works with the Board to help it enact HF’s mission. The ED will be responsible for:

 * Leading HF in a manner that supports the organization’s mission.
 * Communicating effectively with the Board and providing, in a timely and accurate manner, all information necessary for the Board to function properly and to make informed judgements.

 * Fiscal integrity of HF, ensure that the Board is able to monitor the financial condition of HF. This means preparing budgets and financial statements which accurately reflect the financial condition of the organization and are kept up to date.
 
## Salary and Employment

The ED can live anywhere in the world – remote working is the standard within HF. Collaborators and partners work in many time zones, and so flexibility around scheduling is important. The ED should also expect several trips to conferences and other events annually.

The ED must be eligible under USA law and the law in their jurisdiction to perform work (as an employee or as a contractor) for a non-profit organization incorporated in the USA.

Salary will be commensurate with the experience and qualities of the candidate, and will also reflect the Foundation’s status as a non-profit organization funded by donations.

## Key Credentials and Personal Qualities

Candidates are encouraged to apply with the expectation that the Board will assist and coach in areas of personal development tailored to the successful candidate’s needs.

**Essential attributes:**

 * Self-starter, with strong motivational and staff leadership abilities.
 * Demonstrated technical expertise, via industrial experience and/or an advanced degree in CS, math or a related technical field.
 * Exceptional people skills, encompassing the ability to form genuinely trusting and respectful relationships, with both individuals and organizations, communicating in person, in video calls, by email, and other means.
 * Willingness to execute fundraising plans and strategies that generate significant results.
 * Commitment to results; “can-do" mindset with emphasis on accountability.
 * Integrity and impeccable work ethic.

**Desirable Attributes:**

 * Experience in development and organizational leadership in a non-profit or business setting.
 * Experience in writing persuasive materials including successful appeals, proposals, presentations, stewardship materials, and other collateral.
