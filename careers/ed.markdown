## About the Haskell Foundation

The [Haskell Foundation (HF)](https://haskell.foundation) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to broadening the adoption of Haskell, by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research.

## The Role

HF seeks a full-time Executive Director (ED) to continue to inspire and develop the organization. The ED is responsible for furthering HF’s mission and vision, ensuring that resources are in place to accomplish its goals. The ED will drive sourcing for sponsorships, structure the organization, recruit and channel the efforts of both volunteers and paid staff.

Working with HF's Board of Directors, the ED will articulate HF’s strategic priorities and direction. They will assess and evaluate strategies, hire teams, set budgets, forge alliances, and build partnerships to further the mission.

The ED will play a crucial role in building the culture of HF around community service. HF will succeed if and only if it succeeds in unlocking the expertise and enthusiasm of volunteer members of the community. This will be a major goal for the ED, so that volunteers find HF to be a solid professional home with ample opportunities for recognition and professional growth.

Finally, the ED will actively promote HF to build its financial reserves and goodwill. They will secure, budget, and allocate resources appropriately and hold themselves accountable for the financial health of the organization.
